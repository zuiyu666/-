The models in this group are characterized by reversible deformations upon unloading; the stressstrain laws are linear and path-independent.

1.5.2 Elastic, Transversely Isotropic Model
*弹性横向各向同性模型*
A transversely isotropic body has a plane of elastic symmetry (and all directions in such a plane are elastically equivalent) at each point, and these planes are parallel at all points. The model deforms as a two-dimensional slice of a transversely isotropic elastic material subjected to plane-strain or plane-stress boundary conditions in the global xy plane, and oriented such that the global z-axis is parallel with the planes of isotropy(see Figure 1.1).
>横向各向同性体在每一点上都有一个弹性对称平面(该平面上的所有方向都是弹性等效的)，并且这些平面在所有点上都是平行的。该模型变形为横向各向同性弹性材料的二维切片，在平面应变或平面应力边界条件下，在全局xy平面上，并定向使全局z轴与各向同性平面平行(见图1.1)。

There are five independent constants in the elastic, transversely isotropic model. The constants are specified in terms of an orthogonal material coordinate system, x1, x2, x3, in which the x2 axis is normal to a plane of symmetry, with the x1 and x3 axes directed arbitrarily in this plane. The material coordinate system is oriented by specifying the angle φ (measured positive counterclockwise from the global x-axis) and noting that the x3 axis is parallel with the global z-axis (see Figure 1.1).
A bedded material can be well approximated as a transversely isotropic body with the x1x3 plane coinciding with the bedding plane.
>在弹性横向各向同性模型中有五个独立常数。
常数是用正交材料坐标系x1, x2, x3来表示的，其中x2轴垂直于一个对称平面，而x1和x3轴则在这个平面上任意指向。
通过指定角度φ(从全局x轴逆时针方向测量)和注意x3轴与全局z轴平行(参见图1.1)来确定材料坐标系的方向。
层理材料可以很好地近似为横向各向同性体，其x1x3平面与层理平面重合。

There are five elastic constants:
E1 modulus of elasticity in plane of isotropy
E2 modulus of elasticity in plane perpendicular to plane of isotropy
G12 cross-shear modulus between plane of isotropy and perpendicular
plane (i.e., x1x2- or x2x3-plane)
ν21 Poisson’s ratio for the normal strain in the x1-direction (in the plane
of isotropy) related to the normal strain in the x2-direction (in the
perpendicular plane) due to uniaxial stress in the x2-direction
ν31 Poisson’s ratio for the normal strain in the x1-direction (in the plane
of isotropy) related to the normal strain in the x3-direction due to
uniaxial stress in the x3-direction
