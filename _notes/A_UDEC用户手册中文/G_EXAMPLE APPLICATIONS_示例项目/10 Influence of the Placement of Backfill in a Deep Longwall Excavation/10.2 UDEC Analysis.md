The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the response of the rock mass and the behavior of the backfill during staged excavation. The seam and immediate roof use a finer zoning (Figure 10.3), in order to obtain a clearer picture of the stress distribution in the rock and backfill as the excavation and backfilling progresses.
>该分析的目的是研究分段开挖期间岩体的响应和回填的行为。煤层和直接顶板采用了更精细的分区（图10.3），以便在开挖和回填过程中更清晰地了解岩石和回填中的应力分布。

The UDEC analysis begins at an equilibrium state defined by the initial stress conditions. The base boundary of the model is a “no vertical displacement” boundary (line of symmetry), while the two vertical boundaries have imposed zero horizontal displacement (also lines of symmetry).
Note that, in this example, the boundaries are too close to permit the accurate simulation of a single longwall excavation. The example is only intended to demonstrate the behavior of the various block constitutive models.
>UDEC分析从初始应力条件定义的平衡状态开始。模型的基本边界是“无垂直位移”边界（对称线），而两个垂直边界施加了零水平位移（也是对称线）。
注意，在本例中，边界太近，无法精确模拟单个长壁开挖。该示例仅用于演示各种块体本构模型的行为。

The seam is excavated by changing the seam blocks to a null material (block zone cmodel assign null), and backfilled by changing the null material to a double-yield material (block zone cmodel assign double-yield). The excavation phase begins by excavating (nulling) a 10-m long section of blocks at the lower-left corner of the model. After a 10-m section has been excavated, backfill is placed in the section while the next section is excavated. Note that the excavation and backfilling are performed instantaneously in this example. Figure 10.4 shows the material models assigned for the second excavation/fill step.
>通过将煤层块更改为空材料（块区cmodel分配空）挖掘煤层，并通过将空材料更改为双屈服材料（块区cmodel指定双屈服）回填。开挖阶段首先在模型左下角开挖（清除）一段10 m长的砌块。开挖10 m路段后，在开挖下一路段的同时，在该路段进行回填。注意，在本例中，开挖和回填是同时进行的。图10.4显示了为第二个挖掘/填充步骤指定的材料模型。

The vertical displacements in the roof, and the vertical stress in the backfill, are monitored while the excavation continues.
>在继续开挖的同时，监测顶板的垂直位移和回填的垂直应力。

The stress states, after the seam has been excavated 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m, are shown in Figures 10.5 through 10.9. The distribution of the vertical stress in the backfill is superimposed on the stress plots. These figures give a broad picture of the system response. A classical arching effect develops.
>煤层开挖10 m、20 m、30 m、40 m和50 m后的应力状态如图10.5至10.9所示。回填中的垂直应力分布叠加在应力图上。这些数字概括了系统响应。形成了经典的拱形效应。

Very far from the face, the vertical stress sustained by the backfill must approach the in-situ stress (67.5 MPa). It can be seen in Figure 10.9 (40 m behind the face excavated for 50 m) that the backfill is sustaining only about one-third of the load. If a Mohr-Coulomb material had been used in place of the double-yield model, the backfill would have already taken up most of the load (compare Figure 10.9 to Figure 10.10). The volumetric failure produced by the double-yield model results in the reduced load in the backfill.
>在离工作面很远的地方，回填土承受的垂直应力必须接近地应力（67.5 MPa）。从图10.9中可以看出（开挖面后40 m处50 m处），回填仅承受约三分之一的荷载。如果使用莫尔-库仑材料代替双屈服模型，回填材料将已经承担了大部分荷载（对比图10.9和图10.10）。双屈服模型产生的体积破坏导致回填材料中的荷载降低。
