*UDEC分析*

The UDEC modeling sequence was performed in three stages. First, the model without the over-cut excavation was consolidated under the in-situ stresses. Next, the excavation was introduced and the model cycled to an equilibrium state. The stress distribution around the over-cut at this stage is illustrated in Figure 1.2. The blocks immediately above and below the over-cut have slipped and then stabilized.
>UDEC建模序列分三个阶段进行。首先，无超挖的模型在地应力作用下固结。接下来，引入开挖，模型循环至平衡状态。图1.2显示了该阶段超挖周围的应力分布。紧邻超挖上方和下方的块体已经滑动，然后稳定。

In the third stage, two different seismic events with different peak velocities were evaluated. For all seismic simulations, viscous boundaries were introduced around the outer perimeter of the problem domain to eliminatewave reflections, thereby simulating an infinite rock mass. Seismic events were represented by a sinusoidal y-directed stress wave applied at the top of the model. The applied stress wave was superimposed on the existing in-situ stresses.
>在第三阶段，评估了两个峰值速度不同的地震事件。对于所有地震模拟，在问题域的外周长周围引入粘性边界，以消除波反射，从而模拟无限岩体。地震事件由施加在模型顶部的正弦y向应力波表示。施加的应力波叠加在现有的地应力上。

In the first simulation, a peak stress of 1.25MPawas applied. Note that, due to the viscous boundary conditions in effect at the top of the model, the “effective” applied stress is 1.25 MPa/2, or 0.625 MPa. The stress distribution in the roof of the excavation after 0.02 second is shown in Figure 1.3.
Displacements were monitored at two points. Point 1 is located in the left corner of the excavation; Point 2 is located at the right corner of the roof block. Displacement versus time plots (Figure 1.4) for these points essentially show an elastic response.
>在第一次模拟中，施加了1.25MPa的峰值应力。注意，由于模型顶部有效的粘性边界条件，“有效”施加应力为1.25 MPa/2或0.625 MPa。0.02秒后开挖顶板的应力分布如图1.3所示。
在两点监测位移。点1位于开挖的左角；点2位于车顶块的右角。这些点的位移与时间关系图（图1.4）基本上显示了弹性响应。

It is interesting to compare estimated applied velocities with calculated velocities at the top of the model. The following equation can be used to estimate the applied velocity.
>比较模型顶部的估算应用速度和计算速度很有趣。以下方程可用于估算应用的速度。

$$V=\frac{\sigma}{2\left(\rho C_{p}\right)}$$
$$\text { where } C_{p}=[(K+(4 / 3) G) / \rho]^{1 / 2} \text {. }$$

Using this equation, the applied maximum velocity is found to be approximately 0.04 m/sec.
Figure 1.5 shows a peak velocity of approximately 0.06 m/sec. Differences between estimated velocities and measured velocities result from using the intact rock modulus instead of the equivalent deformation modulus, which takes into account the joint deformation.
>使用该方程，应用的最大速度约为0.04 m/sec。
图1.5显示了约0.06 m/sec的峰值速度。估计速度和测量速度之间的差异是由于使用完整岩石模量而不是等效变形模量，等效变形模量考虑了节理变形

In the second example, a stress wave with peak stress of 12.5 MPa (“effective” stress = 6.25 MPa) was applied. The stress distribution in the roof of the excavation after 0.02 second is shown in Figure 1.6. This figure shows that the roof block is unstressed, indicating that the block has loosened. Displacement versus time plots (Figure 1.7) also indicate that the block has loosened and is falling. As a matter of interest, the problem geometry and stress distribution at three later times are presented in Figures 1.8 through 1.10.
>在第二个示例中，应用了峰值应力为12.5 MPa（“有效”应力=6.25 MPa）的应力波。0.02秒后开挖顶板的应力分布如图1.6所示。该图显示顶板砌块未受力，表明砌块已松动。位移与时间的关系图（图1.7）也表明该区块已松动并正在下降。值得关注的是，图1.8至1.10显示了问题几何形状和随后三次的应力分布。

The predicted velocity (from the equation above) at the top of the problem is 0.4 m/sec. The velocity calculated from the model is shown in Figure 1.11. Again, differences between predicted and measured velocities result from using intact rock modulus instead of rock mass deformation modulus.
>问题顶部的预测速度（根据上述方程）为0.4米/秒。根据模型计算的速度如图1.11所示。同样，预测速度和测量速度之间的差异是由于使用完整的岩石模量而不是岩体变形模量造成的。
