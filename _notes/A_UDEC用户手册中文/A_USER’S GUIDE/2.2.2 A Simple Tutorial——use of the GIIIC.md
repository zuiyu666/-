>You can now begin the model creation. To set up the initial block, you should click on the *Block tool* from the Build modeling stage. This tool creates the initial model geometry via the ***block create*** command.
>等于 block creat 命令

> A New block dialog, as shown in Figure 2.11, opens first so you can enter the outer dimensions of the starting block for this model. The block constants, corner rounding length and minimum edge length are also specified in this dialog. 
> 打开新的dialog，可以指定块常数、拐角舍入长度和最小边长度。![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112131622.png)

>You can press OK in the New block dialog after setting the block dimensions to 10 by 10 and selecting the automatic settings for rounding length and edge length, as shown in Figure 2.11. 
>块尺寸设置为10 x 10并选择舍入长度和边长度的自动设置

>A plot of the block will now be shown in the Block tool. This example is using SI units, and therefore the model domain is 10 m by 10 m. See Figure 2.12. Note that the boundary can be changed, and additional corners and edges can be added by using this tool. You can accept the present boundary geometry by pressing Execute. A block create command is created and executed in UDEC. The GIIC returns to the model-view pane. 
>可以使用此工具更改边界，并添加其他角点和边。通过按“执行”，可以接受当前的边界几何图形。![Pasted image 20220520111511](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202125.png)

### 3.2 节理设置
>At this point, joints can be added to the model by clicking on the *Joints tool* in the Build stage. (If you want to limit the jointing to specific areas of the model, you should first click on the JRegions tool to define separate joint regions.) 
>现在可以设置块连结![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112131741.png)

>In the *Joints tool*, you click on the **Joint-Continuous radio** button. You can click on the **Input shape** button to input the geometry via the *JSet* (continuous) dialog. Figure 2.13 shows the dialog with the values specified for the continuous joint set. Click OK and then click Generate shape to accept the configuration. A virtual joint set will be drawn in the Joints tool, as shown in Figure 2.14.
>在“节理工具”中，单击“节理连续”单选按钮。可以单击“输入形状”按钮，通过JSet (统计节理组生成器)对话框输入几何图形。单击确定，然后单击生成形状以接受配置![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112131117.png)


### 3.3 画圆
>You can create the circular tunnel by selecting the **Circle radio** button. You should move the mouse to a position on the block corresponding to the tunnel center, and press and hold the left mouse button while dragging the mouse. A *circle tool* with two red boxes will appear: one at the centroid, and one along the circle periphery (see Figure 2.15). You can move the circle and adjust its radius by pressing and holding the left mouse button while the mouse is positioned within each box. 
>建圆，鼠标移至中心点，按住左键并移动。当鼠标位于每个框中时，按住鼠标左键可以移动圆并调整其半径。
>
>Alternatively, you can select values for the centroid coordinates and the circle radius with dialogs that open when you right-click the mouse while it is positioned within each box. The circle in Figure 2.15 is centered at x = 5.0, y = 5.0, and has a radius of 2.0 m.
>也可以使用对话框选择圆心坐标和圆半径的值，当鼠标位于每个框中时，右键单击鼠标会打开这些对话框。![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112131228.png)

>When you press **Generate shape** , the circle is added to the block. Note that this is a “virtual” block: any alterations you make within this block can be undone or changed. You simply press one of the arrow keys above the Changes pane to remove (or add) a command corresponding to the shape created in the virtual block.
>按“生成形状”时，圆将添加到块中。 这是一个“虚拟”块(在此块中所做的任何更改都可以撤消或更改)。

>Once you are satisfied with the alteration, you should press **Execute** . This sends the command(s) to UDEC. The UDEC commands are processed, and the model with multiple blocks is displayed, as shown in Figure 2.16. The UDEC commands created thus far are shown in the Record pane in this figure.
>改完按**Execute** 才会显示到窗口


### 3.4 块的分区 *Alter stage* 2 - 22
>Next you should press the *Zone tool* in the *Alter stage* in order to make the blocks deformable. In this tool, you can select the zoning that will be applied to the blocks. You can select a maximum zone edge length of 0.5, and press **Set all** . Lines representing the approximate size of the zones that will be generated will be drawn on the model. 
>可以选择将应用于块的分区。可以选择最大分区边长度0.5，然后按**Set all**。将在模型上绘制表示将生成的分区的近似大小的线。

>Then press the **Execute** button. This will cause the generation of the commands to zone the model. Now you should see a graphic of the zoned model in the model-view pane
>按下执行按钮。这将生成命令对模型进行分区。现在，您应该在“模型视图”窗格中看到分区模型的图形![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112132279.png)


### 3.5 材质 *Material stage*
#### 3.5.1 结构材质
>You can use the *Material stage* to create and assign materials and their properties to the deformable blocks and joints within the model. Deformable block materials are created from the *ZoneMat tool*. 
>可以使用“材质阶段”创建材质及其特性，并将其指定给模型中的可变形块和节理。可变形块材质是从*ZoneMat tool*创建的。

>You should press the **Create** button in this tool to create a material. A Property editor dialog opens, as shown in Figure 2.18. You select a constitutive model (in this case the [[X_Attachment/01_Words Attachments/isotropic|isotropic]] elastic model), and then assign a classification and material name. Soils and rocks can be divided into different classifications (such as “Tunnel” rock), with separate material names within a classification (such as “strong rock” and “weak rock”). The classification and material name are used to associate a group range name with each material.
>使用“创建”按钮来创建材质。
>通过打开的*属性编辑器*选择模型，以及对应的分类和材质名称。

>You can create one material for this analysis: “rock” within the classification “Tunnel.” 
>选择“Tunnel”分类中的“rock”
>
>*A database of common soil and rock materials and properties is also available by pressing the **Database** button in the lower-right corner of the ZoneMat tool. The database is divided into classification groups and material names. You can also create your own database of common materials within this database tool, which can be saved and loaded for other projects. Database materials are stored in a file with extension “.GPF.”*
>*按ZoneMat工具右下角的“**数据库**”按钮，还可以获得常见土壤和岩石材料及特性的数据库。数据库可以自己创建，也可保存别人的。数据库文件保存在“.GPF”文件中。*

>The Property editor dialog with the selected properties for the rock is shown in Figure 2.18:
>岩石选定特性的特性编辑器对话框![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112135941.png)

>You should press **OK** in the Property editor dialog to create the material. The material is added to a material List shown on the right side of the ZoneMat tool. Once all the materials required for an analysis have been created and added to the list, they can be assigned to the zones. It is possible to assign different materials to different zones in the blocks, or to different marked regions of blocks, using the Range tools provided in the ZoneMat tool. In this example, you should assign the rock material to all zones. You should highlight the Tunnel:rock item and press the Set All button to assign this material to all zones in the block. Figure 2.19 shows the ZoneMat tool with the rock material assigned. The group command is listed in the Changes pane when the material is assigned. You can now press Execute to send the commands to UDEC.
>在“特性编辑器”对话框中按“确定”以创建材质。
>创建分析所需的所有材质并将其添加到列表后，即可将其指定给分区。可以使用ZoneMat工具中提供的范围工具，将不同材质指定给块中的不同分区，或块的不同标记区域。在本例中，应将岩石材质指定给所有分区。应高亮显示“隧道：岩石”项目，然后按“全部设置”按钮将此材质指定给块中的所有分区。
>图2.19显示了指定了岩石材料的ZoneMat工具。指定材质时，“更改”窗格中将列出“组”命令。现在可以按Execute将命令发送到UDEC。![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112134245.png)

#### 3.5.2 joint （节理）材质
>You can select the JointMat tool in the Materials stage to create and assign materials and their properties to the joints within the model. 
>可以在“材质”阶段中选择“JointMat”工具，以创建材质及其特性并将其指定给模型中的节理。

>Joint materials are created from a Property editor dialog that is opened by pressing the **Create** button in the JointMat tool. Within this dialog, you can assign a classification and material name, prescribe a joint constitutive model type, and assign the material properties.*
>joint材质是从属性编辑器对话框中创建的，该对话框通过按JointMat工具中的“创建”按钮打开。在此对话框中，可以指定分类和材质名称，指定节理本构模型类型，以及指定材质特性
>与模型材质类似，节理材质也储存在数据库中，储存在“ . GPF”文件。

>You can press **OK** in the Property editor dialog to create the joint material. The material is added to a material List shown on the right side of the JointMat tool. Once all the materials required for an analysis have been created and added to the list, they can be assigned to the joints. It is possible to assign different materials to different joints in the block, or to different marked regions of the block, using the Range tools provided in the JointMat tool. In this example, you should create two different joint types: “strong joints” and “weak joints.” The weak-joints material and properties are shown in Figure 2.20. The strong joints have the same shear and normal stiffnesses as the weak joints; the joint friction is 40◦, and the joint cohesion and tensile strength are 100,000 Pa for the strong joints.
>可以在“特性编辑器”对话框中按“确定”创建节理材质。材质将添加到JointMat工具右侧显示的材质列表中。创建分析所需的所有材质并将其添加到列表后，即可将其指定给节理。可以使用JointMat工具中提供的范围工具，将不同材质指定给块中的不同节理，或块的不同标记区域。在本例中，应创建两种不同的节理类型：“强节理”和“弱节理”弱接缝材料和性能，如图2.20所示。强节理与弱节理具有相同的剪切刚度和法向刚度；接头摩擦力为40◦, 对于强接缝，接缝内聚力和抗拉强度为100000 Pa。![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112135581.png)

>First, assign the strong joint material to all joints in the model. (The weak joints will be assigned later in this analysis.) The strong joint material is assigned to all the joints in the model by pressing the **Set All** button in the JointMat tool, as shown in Figure 2.21. Next, press **Execute** to send the joint material property commands to UDEC.
>将强连接材质指定给模型中的所有连接。 **Set All**
>按**execute**，执行指令

#### 3.5.3 分配边界条件 *In Situ modeling stage*
*现场建模阶段*
>The next step is to assign the boundary conditions for our model. 
>为模型分配边界条件

>Select the *Apply tool* from the *In Situ modeling stage*. Roller boundary conditions are applied to the bottom and sides of the model. To prescribe a *roller boundary* on the *sides*, select the *xvelocity* item from the outer boundary list. Hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse to create a box encompassing *the left boundary*. 
>辊边界条件应用于模型的底部和侧面。要在*侧面*上规定*辊子边界*，选择*Apply tool*
>选择*xvelocity*
>按住鼠标左键的同时拖动鼠标以创建一个包围*左边界*的框。

>Then press the **Apply by range** button to open the *Set dialog*. The x-velocity is zero for the boundary fixed in the x-direction and, by specifying this value in the dialog, the velocity is fixed at the selected gridpoints. 
>然后按**Apply by range**打开*Set dialog*。对于x方向上固定的边界，x速度为零，通过在对话框中指定此值，速度在选定网格点处固定。![Pasted image 20220521173431](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202159.png)

>Thus, you are preventing any movement in the x-direction. Press the OK button in the dialog to set the velocities. Then select xvelocity from the item list again and repeat the procedure to fix the right boundary in the x-direction. 
>您正在阻止x方向上的任何移动。按对话框中的“确定”按钮设置速度。然后再次从项目列表中选择xvelocity，并重复该过程以固定x方向上的右边界。![Pasted image 20220521173458](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202193.png)

>Finally, select yvelocity from the item list and apply a zero y-velocity to the bottom boundary.
>>最后，从项目列表中选择yvelocity，并将零y速度应用于底部边界。

>You can access different variables in this model from the *Utility modeling stage*. You wish to monitor the vertical displacement at the crown of the tunnel. To do this, open the *History tool* and then click on the **Gridpoint Data Type radio** button. Then select the **ydisplace history**. Then point the mouse at a gridpoint within the block at the crown of the tunnel. (Be careful not to select a gridpoint on a block that will be deleted later in the simulation.) 
>在Utility阶段改变变量：打开*History tool*，点击**Gridpoint Data Type radio**，选择**ydisplace history**，鼠标指向隧道顶部方块内的节点（不要选择将在稍后的模拟中删除的块上的网格点。）

>When you click on the gridpoint, a block gridpoint history command is created for the y-displacement history at that gridpoint. 
>当您单击网格点时，将为该网格点的y位移历史创建一个块网格点历史命令。![Pasted image 20220521174337](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202224.png)

#### 3.5.4 重力设置 *Settings modeling stage*
>Gravitational loading is specified as a global setting in your model in the *Settings modeling stage*. You can click on the *Gravity tool* to access the *Gravity settings dialog*. Then, by clicking on the globe icon in the dialog, the value of 9.81 m/sec2 is listed as the magnitude of gravitational acceleration. (You can also type in a different value for the magnitude.) The dialog is shown in Figure 2.25:
>使用*Gravity tool*设置重力，点击地球仪图标，设置为9.81 ![Pasted image 20220521174842](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202258.png)

#### 3.5.5 初始平衡状态  *initial equilibrium*
>You are now ready to bring the model to an initial equilibrium state. Cycle the model to a force equilibrium condition under gravity loading. Select the *Run modeling stage*, and then the *Solve tool*. This opens a *Solve options dialog* as shown in Figure 2.26; press **Execute** and invoke the block solve command to detect equilibrium automatically. 
>运行阶段设置初始平衡，点击 *Solve tool* ，打开Solve options对话框，点执行![Pasted image 20220521181354](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202294.png)


>A Model cycling ... dialog now appears, and the timestep number, maximum unbalanced force and equilibrium ratio are displayed. The equilibrium ratio is used to determine [[X_Attachment/01_Words Attachments/equilibrium|equilibrium]]. When the ratio falls below the default limiting value of 10−5, the calculation stops.
>平衡比是用来确定平衡的。当该比值低于默认限制值(10−5)时，计算停止。


1. 注意保存
>It is a good idea to save the project state at the different stages of your analysis. In this way you can easily return to a given state and make modififications without the need to run the entire simulation again. You can save the project model state at the initial-equilibrium stage by pressing the **Save** button at the bottom of the Record pane. This opens a dialog box (as shown in Figure 2.27) that allows the user to give a descriptive title to the saved state, select a folder in which to save the model-state fifile, and name the fifile. By default, the fifile has the extension “.SAV.”
>在不同阶段保存一下，可以在以后快速回到该阶段，不需要再次运行了
>按下*Record*窗格底部的**save**按钮，会打开保存对话框![Pasted image 20220521181902](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202324.png)

>You choose to save the model state as “TUN1.SAV.” You must save this fifile in the same folder as the project fifile “TUNNEL.PRJ,” so that the project can be opened later and all associated save fifiles accessed. The save fifile name is added to a list at the top of the Record pane. (This is the “project tree.”) Each time you save the model state, a new save fifile name will be added to the list. You can click on any fifile name in the list to open that saved state.
>将模型状态保存为“TUN1.SAV”。
>此文件保存在与项目文件" TUNNEL "相同的文件夹
>保存文件名被添加到Record窗格顶部的列表中。(这是“项目树”)


2. 确保达到平衡
>There are several ways to make sure that equilibrium has been reached. A quick check can be done by plotting the change in maximum unbalanced force during stepping. In the Plot modeling stage, select the History button, and then the Unbalanced force plot item. A plot of unbalanced force versus calculation cycle will appear. The plot given in Figure 2.28 shows that the maximum unbalanced force is approaching zero, which indicates that an equilibrium state has been reached. If the unbalanced force history approaches a nonzero value, this is an indication that a portion of the model is failing. Another good way to check whether the model is in equilibrium or failing is to create a plot of velocity vectors in the model. A concentrated region of “large” velocity vectors (greater than approximately 10−5) typically identififies the portion of the model that is failing
>有以下几种方法检查
>快速检查可以通过绘制步进过程中最大不平衡力的变化来完成。 在Plot建模阶段，选择History按钮，然后选择balanced force Plot项目。 将出现不平衡力与计算周期的关系图。 如图2.28所示，最大不平衡力接近于零，表示达到平衡状态。![Pasted image 20220524144749](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202349.png)

>You can create plots for a wide variety of variables in a UDEC model. Click on the Model tool from the *Plot stage* to open the *Plot items dialog box.* The dialog is shown in Figure 2.29. From this dialog you **can access most of the general plotting facilities** in UDEC. (Note that separate tools are provided for table, history, profifile and failure plots in the Plot stage.)
>可以为UDEC模型中的各种变量创建绘图。
>能使用大部分一般绘图工具
>table, history, profifile and failure plots有单独的工具![Pasted image 20220524153147](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206112202391.png)
