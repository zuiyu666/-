In all civil or mining engineering projects, there is an in-situ state of stress in the ground, before any excavation or construction is started. By setting initial conditions in the UDEC model, an attempt is made to reproduce this in-situ state, because it can influence the subsequent behavior of the model.
Ideally, information about the initial state comes from field measurements, but when these are not available the model can be run for a range of possible conditions. Although the range is potentially infinite, there are a number of constraining factors (e.g., the system must be in equilibrium, and the chosen yield and slip criteria must not be violated anywhere).
>在所有的土木或采矿工程项目中，在任何挖掘或施工开始之前，地面都有一个应力状态。
通过在UDEC模型中设置初始条件，可以尝试再现这种原位状态，因为它可以影响模型的后续行为。
理想情况下，关于初始状态的信息来自现场测量，但当这些数据不可用时，模型可以在一系列可能的条件下运行。
尽管这个范围可能是无限的，但仍有许多限制因素(例如，系统必须处于平衡状态，所选择的屈服和滑移准则不得在任何地方被违反)。

In a uniform layer of soil or rock with a free surface, the vertical stresses are usually equal to gρz, where g is the gravitational acceleration, ρ is the mass density of the material, and z is the depth below surface. However, the in-situ horizontal stresses are more difficult to estimate. There is a common – but erroneous – belief that there is some “natural” ratio between horizontal and vertical stress, given by ν/(1−ν), where ν is the Poisson’s ratio. This formula is derived from the assumption that gravity is suddenly applied to an elastic mass of material in which lateral movement is prevented.
This condition hardly ever applies in practice, due to repeated tectonic movements, material failure, overburden removal and locked-in stresses due to faulting and localization (see Section 3.11.3). Of course, if we had enough knowledge of the history of a particular volume of material, we might simulate the whole process numerically, in order to arrive at the initial conditions for our planned engineering works. This approach is not usually feasible. Typically, we compromise: a set of stresses is installed in the model, and then UDEC is run until an equilibrium state is obtained. It is important to realize that there are an infinite number of equilibrium states for any given system.
>在具有自由表面的均匀土壤或岩石层中，垂直应力通常等于gρz，其中g是重力加速度，ρ是材料的质量密度，z是表面以下的深度。然而，现场水平应力更难估计。有一种常见但错误的观点，即水平应力和垂直应力之间存在某种“自然”比率，由ν/(1−ν)给出。式中，ν是泊松比。这个公式是根据重力突然作用于防止横向运动的弹性材料块的假设推导出来的。
由于重复的构造运动、材料破坏、覆盖层移除以及断层和局部作用产生的锁定应力，这种情况在实践中几乎不适用（见第3.11.3节）。当然，如果我们对特定体积材料的历史有足够的了解，我们可能会对整个过程进行数值模拟，以达到我们计划工程的初始条件。这种方法通常不可行。通常，我们妥协：在模型中安装一组应力，然后运行UDEC，直到达到平衡状态。重要的是要认识到，任何给定的系统都有无穷多的平衡态。

In the following sections, we examine progressively more complicated situations and the ways in which the initial conditions may be specified. The user is encouraged to experiment with the various data files that are presented.
