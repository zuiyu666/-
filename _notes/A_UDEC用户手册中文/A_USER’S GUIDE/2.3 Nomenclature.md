*术语*

The nomenclature used in UDEC is similar, for the most part, to that used in continuum stress analysis programs. In addition, though, special terminology is used to describe the discontinuum features in a UDEC model. The basic definitions are given here for clarification. Figure 2.45 is provided to illustrate UDEC terminology.

UDEC MODEL – The UDEC model is created by the user to simulate a physical problem. When referring to a UDEC model, we imply a sequence of UDEC commands (see Help in UDEC .) Section 1 in the Command Reference) which define the problem conditions for numerical solution.

BLOCK – The block is the fundamental geometric entity for the distinct element calculation. The UDEC model is created by “cutting” a single block into many smaller blocks. Each block is an independent entity that may be detached from other blocks or may interact with other blocks via contact forces.

CONTACT – Each block is connected to adjacent blocks via point contacts. A contact may be considered a boundary condition which applies external forces to each block. The term “joint” may also be used to refer to a single contact or a set of contacts.

DISCONTINUITY–Adiscontinuity is a geologic feature that separates a physical mass into distinct parts. Discontinuities include, for example, joints, faults and fractures and other discontinuous features in a rock mass.
To be represented in UDEC, a discontinuity must have a length scale which is approximately of the same order as the engineering structure being analyzed. A discontinuity in UDEC is defined by two or more contacts.
JOINT ID – Each time an operation cuts a block into two blocks, the contacts that are formed between the blocks are tagged with an ID number. The number may be assigned by the user. If not assigned, the ID number will be automatically incremented with each command. Contacts formed by the same command will have a common ID number.
DOMAIN – A domain is the void or space between blocks. Domains are treated as physical entities in the UDEC model; each domain is an enclosed region defined by two or more contacts. The “outer domain” is the region surrounding the UDEC model. Note that a domain exists between the adjoining faces of two overlapping blocks, even though the domain area appears to be negative (see Section 1.2.4 in Theory and Background). Contact detection is performed within domains.
Fluid flow occurs between domains (see Section 2 in Special Features). Domains are not created if block config cell is used.
ZONE – Deformable blocks are composed of finite-difference zones. Mechanical changes (e.g., stress/strain) and thermal changes (i.e., heat transfer) are calculated within each zone. Triangular zones are used in UDEC.
GRIDPOINT – Gridpoints are associated with the corners of the finite-difference zones. There are always three gridpoints associated with each zone. A pair of x- and y-coordinates is defined for each gridpoint, thus specifying the exact location of the finite-difference zones. Another term for gridpoint is nodal point or node.

GROUP – A group is a gathering of objects. Blocks, zones and contacts may be members of a group. Groups are referenced by a text name. Group names may be used as input to ranges.
MODEL BOUNDARY – The model boundary is the periphery of the UDEC model. This boundary coincides with the outer domain of the model. Internal boundaries (i.e., holes within the model) are also model boundaries. Each internal boundary is defined by an internal domain.
BOUNDARY CONDITION – A boundary condition is the prescription of a constraint or controlled condition along a model boundary (e.g., a fixed displacement or force for mechanical problems, or adiabatic boundary for heat transfer problems).
INITIAL CONDITIONS – This is the state of all variables in the model (e.g., stresses) prior to any loading change or disturbance (e.g., excavation).
NULL BLOCK – Null blocks are blocks which represent voids (i.e., no material present) within the model. Null blocks can be made “real” later in an analysis – for example, to simulate backfilling.
(Once a block is deleted from a model it cannot be restored, however it may be recreated.)

STRUCTURAL ELEMENT – Structural elements are one-dimensional elements used to represent the interaction of structures (such as tunnel liners, rockbolts, cable bolts or support props) with a rock mass. Material nonlinearity is possible with structural elements. Geometric nonlinearity occurs in large-strain mode.
STEP – Since UDEC is an explicit code, the solution to a problem requires a number of computational steps. During computational stepping, the information associated with the phenomenon under investigation is propagated across the blocks in the model. A certain number of steps is required to arrive at an equilibrium (or steady-flow) state for a static solution. Typical problems are solved within 2000 to 4000 steps, although large, complex problems can require tens of thousands of steps to reach a steady state. When doing a dynamic analysis, block step or block cycle refers to the actual timestep for the dynamic problem. Other terms for step are timestep and cycle.
STATIC SOLUTION – A static or quasi-static solution is reached in UDEC when the rate of change of kinetic energy in a model approaches a negligible value. This is accomplished by damping the equations of motion. At the static solution stage, the model will either be at a state of force equilibrium or steady flow of material if a portion (or all) of the model is unstable (i.e., fails) under the applied loading conditions. This is the default calculation mode in UDEC*, and can also be invoked with the block damp local command. Static mechanical solutions can be coupled to transient fluid-flow or heat-transfer solutions.

UNBALANCED FORCE – The unbalanced force indicates when a mechanical equilibrium state (or the onset of joint slip or plastic flow) is reached for a static analysis. A model is in exact equilibrium if the net nodal force vector at each block centroid or gridpoint is zero. The maximum nodal force vector is monitored in UDEC, and printed to the screen when the block step, block cycle or block solve command is invoked. The maximum nodal force vector is also called the “unbalanced” or “out-of-balance” force. The maximum unbalanced force will never exactly reach zero for a numerical analysis. The model is considered to be in equilibrium when the maximum unbalanced force is small compared to the representative forces in the problem. If the unbalanced force approaches a constant nonzero value, this probably indicates that joint slip or block failure and plastic flow are occurring within the model.
DYNAMIC SOLUTION – Fully dynamic analysis can be performed by inhibiting the default static solution damping. For a dynamic solution, the full dynamic equations of motion (including inertial terms) are solved; the generation and dissipation of kinetic energy directly affect the solution.
Dynamic solutions are required for problems involving high frequency and short duration loads (e.g., seismic or explosive loading).

LARGE-STRAIN/SMALL-STRAIN – By default, UDEC operates in large-strain mode: block coordinates and gridpoint coordinates are updated at each step, according to computed displacements.
UDEC can also be run in small-strain mode, in which case coordinates are not changed, even if computed displacements are large.
