Forces are accumulated at each centroid of rigid blocks and each gridpoint of deformable blocks.
At equilibrium – or steady plastic flow in deformable blocks – the algebraic sum of these forces is almost zero (i.e., the forces acting on one side of the block centroid or gridpoint nearly balance those acting on the other). During timestepping, the maximum unbalanced force is determined for the whole model; this force is displayed continuously on the screen. It can also be saved as a history and viewed as a graph. The unbalanced force is important in assessing the state of the model for static analysis, but its magnitude must be compared with the magnitude of typical internal forces acting in the model. In otherwords, it is necessary to knowwhat constitutes a “small” force. Arepresentative internal gridpoint force for deformable blocks may be found by multiplying stress by zone length perpendicular to the force, using values that are typical in the area of interest in the model. Denoting R as the ratio of maximum unbalanced force to the representative internal force, expressed as a percentage, the value of R will never decrease to zero. However, a value of 1% or 0.1% may be acceptable as denoting equilibrium, depending on the degree of precision required (e.g., R = 1% may be good enough for an intermediate stage in a sequence of operations, while R = 0.1% may be used if a final stress or displacement distribution is required for inclusion in a report or paper).
Note that a low value of R only indicates that forces balance at all gridpoints. However, steady plastic flow may be occurring, without acceleration. In order to distinguish between this condition and “true” equilibrium, other indicators, such as those described below, should be consulted.
>力在刚性块体的每个质心和可变形块体的每个格点处积累。
在平衡状态下——或可变形块体中的稳定塑性流动——这些力的代数和几乎为零(即作用在块体质心或网格点一侧的力几乎与作用在另一侧的力平衡)。
在时间步进过程中，确定整个模型的最大不平衡力;
这个力在屏幕上连续显示。
它也可以保存为历史记录，并以图表的形式查看。
不平衡力在静力分析中评估模型的状态是重要的，但它的大小必须与作用在模型中的典型内力的大小进行比较。
换句话说，有必要知道是什么构成了“小”部队。
可变形块体的代表性内部网格力可以通过应力乘以垂直于力的区域长度得到，使用模型中感兴趣区域的典型值。
设R为最大不平衡力与代表性内力之比，用百分数表示，则R的值永远不会降为零。
然而，根据所需的精度，1%或0.1%的值可以被接受为表示平衡(例如，R = 1%可能对一系列操作中的中间阶段足够好，而R = 0.1%可能用于报告或论文中需要包含的最终应力或位移分布)。
注意，低值的R只表示力平衡在所有网格点。
然而，稳定的塑性流动可能发生，没有加速。
为了区分这个条件和“真正的”平衡，应该参考其他指标，例如下面描述的那些。
