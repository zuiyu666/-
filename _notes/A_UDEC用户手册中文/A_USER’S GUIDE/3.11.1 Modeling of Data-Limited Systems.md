*数据有限系统建模*

In a field such as geomechanics, where data are not always available, the methodology used in numerical modeling should be different from that used in a field such as mechanical engineering.
Starfield and Cundall (1988) provide suggestions for an approach to modeling that is appropriate for a data-limited system. This paper should be consulted before any serious modeling with UDEC is attempted. In essence, the approach recognizes that field data (such as in-situ stresses, material properties and geological features) will never be known completely. It is futile to expect the model to provide design data, such as expected displacements, when there is massive uncertainty in the input data. However, a numerical model is still useful in providing a picture of the mechanisms that may occur in particular physical systems. The model acts to educate the intuition of the design engineer by providing a series of cause-and-effect examples. The models may be simple, with assumed data that are consistent with known field data and engineering judgement. It is a waste of effort to construct a very large and complicated model that may be just as difficult to understand as the real case.
>在地质力学等领域，数据并不总是可用的，在数值建模中使用的方法应该不同于在机械工程等领域中使用的方法。
Starfield和Cundall(1988)为适合数据有限系统的建模方法提供了建议。
在尝试使用UDEC进行任何严肃的建模之前，都应该参考本文。
从本质上说，这种方法认识到，现场数据(如地应力、材料性质和地质特征)永远不会被完全了解。
当输入数据中存在大量的不确定性时，期望模型提供设计数据(如预期位移)是徒劳的。
然而，数值模型在提供可能发生在特定物理系统中的机制的图像方面仍然是有用的。
该模型通过提供一系列因果关系示例来培养设计工程师的直觉。
模型可能很简单，假设的数据与已知的现场数据和工程判断一致。
构建一个非常庞大和复杂的模型是一种浪费精力的做法，它可能和实际情况一样难以理解。

Of course, if extensive field data are available, then these may be incorporated into a comprehensive model that can yield design information directly. More commonly, however, the data-limited model does not produce such information directly, but provides insight into mechanisms that may occur. The designer can then do simple calculations, based on these mechanisms, that estimate the parameters of interest or the stability conditions.
>当然，如果可以获得大量的现场数据，那么这些数据可以被合并到一个可以直接产生设计信息的综合模型中。
然而，更常见的是，数据有限的模型并不直接产生这种信息，而是提供对可能发生的机制的洞察。
然后，设计者可以基于这些机制进行简单的计算，估计感兴趣的参数或稳定性条件。
