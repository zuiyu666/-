All input commands* to UDEC are word-oriented.The command syntax has been designed in a way that commands in all Itasca codes will behave in a similar manner. To differentiate commands that are intended only for UDEC , most UDEC commands will begin with the word BLOCK. 
>UDEC中的所有命令都是以单词为基础的。
>大多数UDEC命令都以block开头

All commands in the program are words that consist of a primary word (a noun/object) and a fifirst keyword (a verb/action). Because of the preceeding BLOCK word, the primary word may actually consist of two words (i.e. BLOCK ZONE, BLOCK CONTACT) preceeding the verb. To this foundation may be added options and modififiers (adverb(s)), and a range (a prepositional phrase). In other words, commands syntactically mimic natural language.
>所有命令都是由一个主单词+修饰构成

The syntactical pattern is expressed as:NOUN (NOUN) - VERB - OPTION(S) - MODIFIER(S) - RANGE
Note the order is consistent and required in all commands.
>名词-动词-选项(个)-修饰词(个)-范围
>顺序要一致
