使用*命令*建立模型的实例

### 0. 介绍
>The example is a four-block slope stability problem. We evaluate the stability for different conditions of joint friction. The project fifile “**slide.udprj**” included in the folder ITASCA\UDEC700\Datafifiles\Users Guide\Getting Started\Slide tutorial, contains all of the commands we are about to enter interactively.)
>例子是一个*四块体边坡稳定性问题*。
>项目文件在slide.udprj

>We can run this problem interactively (i.e., by typing the commands from the keyboard, pressing Enter at the end of each command line, and seeing the results directly).
>我们可以交互式地运行这个问题(即，通过从键盘输入命令，在每个命令行末尾按Enter，并直接查看结果)。
### 1. 运行
>To begin, load UDEC 7.0.
>The problem begins by specifying a single block using the block create command:
>```fish
>block create polygon (0,0) (0,20) (20,20) (20,0)
>```
>![Pasted image 20220525112944](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206121529044.png)

>This command creates a square block with side lengths of 20 units (in this case, meters). To see the block, select a block plot from the plot item list.A picture of the block will appear on the screen. If the round attribute is selected the corners appear slightly rounded. The rounding is used in UDEC to give reasonable physical behavior to blocks that just slightly overlap each other. The rounding length may be adjusted by the user.
>如果选择了round属性，那么这些角看起来会稍微圆润一些。
### 2. 分割
>The problem is continued by splitting the initial block into smaller blocks by typing
>键入将初始块分割为更小的块
>```fish
>block cut crack (0,2) (20,8)
>block cut crack (5,3) (5,20)
>block cut crack (5,12) (20,18)
>```
>这些命令沿着带有端点(由括号中的坐标指定)的行分割现有的块。

>Next, the lowermost and leftmost blocks are immobilized by typing
>接下来，固定最底部和最左边的块
>```fish
>block fix all range position-x 0,20 position-y 0,5
>block fix all range position-x 0,5 position-y 0,20
>```
>固定形心处在 0<x<20，0<y<5 和 0<x<5，0<y<20 范围内的所有块体的当前速度（即为零）
>![Pasted image 20220525160837](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206121529046.png)

>Then, required material properties are assigned to a property number for the blocks and joints by typing
>然后，将所需的材料属性分配给块和节理
>```udec
>block prop mat=1 dens=2000
>block contact cmodel assign area st-n=1.33e7 st-s=1.33e7 fric=20.0
>```
>For this problem, the mass density of all blocks is specifified to be 2,000 units (kg/m3, in this case). Note that the mass density, not the unit weight of the block material, is assigned. All joints are specifified to have contact normal (st-n) and shear (st-s) stiffness equal to 1.33 ×107 (here, Pa/m) and friction angles equal to 20°. As will be seen later, different properties can be assigned to various joints and intact blocks.
>对于这个问题，*指定所有块的质量密度为2000单位(这里是kg/m3)*。
>请注意，分配的是*质量密度*，而不是块材料的单位重量。
>所有接头都指定有接触法线(st-n)和剪切(st-s)刚度等于1.33×107(这里，Pa/m)和摩擦角等于20°。

>Next, gravitational accelerations in x- and y-directions are specifified by typing
>继续指定x和y方向的*重力加速度*
>```udec
>block mech gravity 0 -10
>```

>In order to absorb vibrational energy, damping is introduced by typing
>为了吸收振动能量，输入阻尼命令
>```udec
>block mechanical damp local
>```
>This is the default damping condition in UDEC, and the block mechanical damp local command is actually not required here. We use it only to emphasize that this is a static analysis.
>**在这里不需要本命令**

>In this problem, we monitor the y-velocity of a point at the top-right corner of the model.
>追踪右上角点位的y轴速度
>```fish
>block gridpoint history vel-y (20,20)
>model display history 1
>```
>Following execution of this command, the program returns information about the selected monitoring point (20,20). 
>这个命令执行以后，程序会返回统计的信息

>One hundred calculation cycles are executed by typing
>输入命令，计算100个周期
>```fish
>block cycle 100
>```
>模型无变化

>During execution, *the current cycle count, the calculation time, the maximum out-of-balance force, the y-velocity of point (5,20) and the clock time* are printed on the screen every 10 cycles.
>执行中，*循环次数、计算时间、最大失衡力、点的（5,20）的Y轴速度、当前时间*，会每10个周期打印一次。
>Inspection of these values indicates that equilibrium has been obtained. (The velocity and out-of-balance force approach zero.) 
>对这些值的检验表明已达到平衡(速度和不平衡力接近于零。)
>A graphical representation of this behavior is obtained by selecting a history plot from the plot item menu and then selecting tha appropriate history.
>可以选择历史图形

>It is often helpful to save this initial state so that it can be restarted at any time (for example, to perform parameter studies). To save the current state (in a fifile called “SLOPE.SAV”), type
>*保存这个初始状态*通常是有帮助的，这样就可以在任何时候重新启动它(例如，执行参数研究)。要保存当前状态(在一个名为“SLOPE.SAV”的文件中)，键入
>```fish
>model save ’slope.sav’
>```

>The behavior of the slope can be studied by removing the leftmost block by typing
>可以通过键入移除最左边的块来研究边坡的行为
>```fish
>block delete range pos-x 0,5 pos-y 0,20
>```
>This command deletes blocks with centroids in the range 0 <x< 5, 0 <y< 20.
>该命令删除范围为0 <x< 5, 0 <y< 20的块。

>Next, the calculation process continues using the block step or block cycle command. The problem state after 1000 additional cycles (1100 cycles total) is shown in Figure 2.43.
>再算1000个周期![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206180820934.png)

>(补充)再算1000个周期![Pasted image 20220525161332](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206121529049.png)

>The fifigure shows that only the top block is sliding. This is the expected result because the friction angle (20◦) is less than the slope (22◦) of the joint between the two uppermost blocks. A plot of the y-velocity history of the monitored point also indicates that the block is sliding; the velocity is increased at a constant rate.
>图中显示只有顶部块是滑动的。
>这是预期的结果，因为两个最上块之间的摩擦角(20◦)小于斜坡(22◦)。监测点的y轴速度历史曲线也表明块体在滑动;速度以恒定的速率增加。

>The problem may be continued in the manner previously described, but it is interesting to examine the effect of other choices of problem parameters at this point.
>这个问题可以按照前面描述的方式继续下去，但是在这一点上检查问题参数的其他选择的影响是很有趣的。

>The initial save state may be recalled by typing
>```fish
>model restore ’slope.sav’
>```
>selecting “SLOPE.SAV” from the fifile-open dialog.
>恢复初始状态![Pasted image 20220525161413](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206121529050.png)

>The leftmost block is removed as before, but in this case the joint [[X_Attachment/01_Words Attachments/friction|friction]] angle is reduced to 11°. The following command sequence results in Figure 2.44.
>关节摩擦角减少到11°
>```fish
>block delete range pos-x 0,5 pos-y 0,20
>block contact property fric=11
>block cycle 1000
>```
>![](https://obsidianxjb.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/obsidian/202206180820954.png)

>所有块均滑动了
