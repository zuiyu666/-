*地震诱发地面塌陷*
A demonstration simulation of a seismic-induced groundfall is presented to illustrate the use of UDEC for analyzing this type of problem. The model shown in Figure 1.1 was developed based on the configuration and dimensions of the 34-1-554 over-cut shown on a section drawing for Fraser Mine, Falconbridge Limited, Sudbury, Ontario. A two-dimensional, plane-strain representation was chosen normal to the axis of the over-cut. The over-cut was modeled as being 5 m high and 10 m wide.

It was assumed that two continuous joint sets intersect the plane of analysis: one with an orientation of 45◦, and the other with an orientation of −9◦. Both sets have a joint spacing of 5 m. For demonstration purposes, a near vertical “artificial” joint was also added to the block in the roof of the excavation to enhance the instability.
>假设两个连续节理组与分析平面相交：一个方向为45◦, 另一个方向为−9◦. 两组的接缝间距均为5 m。为了便于演示，还向开挖顶部的砌块添加了一个接近垂直的“人工”接缝，以增强不稳定性。

From the average laboratory test values provided for the intact rock, several material properties were assumed for the rock blocks:
>根据为完整岩石提供的平均实验室试验值，假设岩块具有以下几种材料特性：

density 3000 kg/m3
Young’s modulus 75,000 MPa
Poisson’s ratio 0.18

The blocks were assumed to behave elastically only. Coulomb slip behavior was assumed for the joints, and typical textbook values were chosen for joint properties:
>假定砌块仅具有弹性。假定接头具有库仑滑移行为，并为接头特性选择了典型的教科书值：

joint normal stiffness 20,000 MPa/m
joint shear stiffness 20,000 MPa/m
friction angle 30◦
cohesion 0

The in-situ stress state was estimated to be isotropic at 24 MPa (assuming vertical loading due to overlaying rock at a depth of approximately 800 m).
>现场应力状态估计为24 MPa下的各向同性（假设由于约800 m深度的上覆岩石而产生垂直荷载）。
