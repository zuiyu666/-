When modeling infinite bodies (e.g., tunnels underground) or very large bodies, it may not be possible to cover the whole body with blocks, due to constraints on memory and computer time.
当建模无限的物体(例如，地下隧道)或非常大的物体时，由于内存和计算机时间的限制，可能不可能用块覆盖整个物体。

Artificial boundaries are placed sufficiently far away from the area of interest that the behavior in that area is not greatly affected. It is useful to know how far away to place these boundaries and what error might be expected in the stresses and displacements computed for the areas of interest.
人为的边界设置得离感兴趣的区域足够远，使该区域的行为不会受到很大影响。
知道这些边界的位置有多远，以及对感兴趣的区域计算的应力和位移可能会有什么误差是很有用的。

A series of numerical experiments was performed on models containing two tunnels in an elastic material. The model contains only construction joints used to create the two tunnels. The smallest model is shown in Figure 3.21, and the largest in Figure 3.22.
对弹性材料中含有两个隧道的模型进行了一系列数值实验。
该模型只包含用于创建两个隧道的施工缝。
最小模型如图3.21所示，最大模型如图3.22所示。

In all runs, the zone sizes within blocks were the same, so that discretization effects were eliminated.
Two “measurements” were made: vertical displacement, uy , at the top center point of the large tunnel; and the vertical stress, σyy, at the midpoint of the “pillar” between the two tunnels. The insitu stress ratio was 2:1 (vertical-to-horizontal). For each rectangular boundary geometry, two runs were conducted: constant boundary stress and zero boundary displacement. In addition, runs were done with the boundary-element boundary in UDEC. (See Section 3.4.4.3.) Example 3.14 contains representative data files for a constant stress boundary condition, a fixed boundary condition and a boundary-element condition.
>在所有的运行中，区块内的区域大小是相同的，因此离散化效应被消除了。
进行了两次“测量”:大隧道顶部中心点的垂直位移uy;
两隧道间“矿柱”中点处的竖向应力σyy。
地应力比为2:1(垂直—水平)。
对于每个矩形边界几何，进行了两次测试:恒定的边界应力和零边界位移。
此外，利用UDEC中的边界元边界进行了运行。
(见部分3.4.4.3)
例3.14包含了恒应力边界条件、固定边界条件和边界元条件的代表性数据文件。

The results are summarized in nondimensional form in Figure 3.23. The measured displacements and stresses are normalized to their asymptotic values; the value of “boundary size” is the average of width and height, and the “object size” is the average distance across both tunnels. Several points may be noted from Figure 3.23:
>结果在图3.23中以无量纲形式汇总。
将实测的位移和应力归一化到它们的渐近值;
“边界尺寸”的值是宽度和高度的平均值，“物体尺寸”是穿过两个隧道的平均距离。
从图3.23中可以注意到以下几点:

1. Afixed boundary causes both stresses and displacements to be underestimated, while a stress boundary does the opposite.
>固定边界使应力和位移都被低估，而应力边界则相反。
3. The two types of boundary condition “bracket” the true solution, so that it is possible to do two tests with small boundaries and get a reasonable estimate of the true solution by averaging the two results.
>这两种边界条件“括号”为真解，这样就有可能在小边界下进行两次检验，并通过对两个结果的平均得到对真解的合理估计。
5. As a rough guide, for a boundary-to-object size ratio of 5, the error in stress and displacement is around 6% for the fixed and stress boundaries.
>作为一个粗略的指导，当边界与物体尺寸比为5时，对于固定边界和应力边界，应力和位移的误差约为6%。
7. The error for the closest boundary-element boundary is around 0.5%.
>最接近的边界元边界误差在0.5%左右。

It may appear from these results that the boundary elements are the best way to provide an artificial boundary to simulate an infinite medium. However, there is one difficulty: the boundary element solution requires a stiffness matrix to be computed and stored. This storage can impose excessive memory overhead for larger models. (The present version of UDEC restricts the number of boundary-element nodes to no more than 300.) Even with this restriction, boundary elements will be the most efficient scheme for some problems. Before embarking on a series of runs, some preliminary tests, in which various types of boundary are compared, should be done.
>从这些结果可以看出，边界元是模拟无限介质提供人工边界的最佳方法。
然而，有一个难点:边界元解需要一个刚度矩阵来计算和存储。
对于较大的模型，这种存储可能增加过多的内存开销。
(目前版本的UDEC将边界元节点的数量限制在不超过300个。)
即使有这样的限制，边界元仍然是求解某些问题最有效的格式。
在开始一系列运行之前，应该进行一些初步测试，在这些测试中比较不同类型的边界。

The numerical experiments reported above are for elastic bodies. This probably represents the worst case, because the displacements and stress changes are more confined when plastic behavior is present; there is a natural cutoff distance within which most of the action occurs. The artificial boundary may be placed slightly further away without serious error. However, any artificial boundary must not be sufficiently close that it attracts plastic flow or prevents joint displacement, thereby invalidating the solution.
>上述数值实验是针对弹性体的。
这可能代表了最坏的情况，因为当存在塑性行为时，位移和应力变化更受限制;
大多数行为都有一个自然的截止距离。
人工边界可以稍微放远一点而不会有严重误差。
然而，任何人工边界必须不够接近，不能吸引塑性流动或防止关节位移，从而使解决方案无效。
