# 3.3 Selection of Deformable versus Rigid Blocks
*3.3可变形块与刚性块的选择*

An important aspect of a discontinuum analysis is the decision to use rigid blocks or deformable blocks to represent the behavior of intact material. The considerations for rigid versus deformable blocks are discussed in this section. If a deformable block analysis is required, there are several different models available to simulate block deformability; these are discussed in Section 3.7.
>不连续分析的一个重要方面是决定使用刚性块或可变形块来表示完整材料的行为。本节讨论了刚性块和可变形块的注意事项。**如果需要进行可变形块分析，有几种不同的模型可用于模拟块的可变形性**；第3.7节对此进行了讨论。

As mentioned in Section 1 in Theory and Background, early distinct element codes assumed that blocks were rigid. However, the importance of including block deformability is now recognized, particularly for stability analyses of underground openings and studies of seismic response of buried structures. One of the most obvious reasons to include block deformability in a distinct element analysis is the requirement to represent the “Poisson’s ratio effect” of a confined rock mass.
>如第1节理论与背景所述，早期的不同元素代码假设块是刚性的。然而，现在已经认识到包括块体可变形性的重要性，特别是对于地下开口的稳定性分析和地下结构地震反应的研究。在独立元素分析中包括块体变形性的最明显原因之一是需要表示受限岩体的“泊松比效应”。

Rock mechanics problems are usually very sensitive to the Poisson’s ratio chosen for a rock mass.
This is because joints and intact rock are pressure-sensitive: their failure criteria are functions of the confining stress (e.g., the Mohr-Coulomb criterion). Capturing the true Poisson behavior of a jointed rock mass is critical for meaningful numerical modeling.
>岩石力学问题通常对为岩体选择的泊松比非常敏感。这是因为节理和完整岩石是压力敏感的：其破坏标准是围压的函数（例如摩尔-库仑准则）。**捕捉节理岩体的真实泊松行为对于有意义的数值模拟至关重要**。

The effective Poisson’s ratio of a rock mass is made up of two parts: (1) a component due to the jointing; and (2) a component due to the elastic properties of the intact rock. Except at shallow depths or low confining stress levels, the compressibility of the intact rock makes a large contribution to the compressibility of a rock mass as a whole. Thus, the Poisson’s ratio of the intact rock has a significant effect on the Poisson’s ratio of a jointed rock mass.
>岩体的有效泊松比由两部分组成：（1）节理引起的分量；（2）由于完整岩石的弹性特性而产生的成分。除浅层或低围压水平外，完整岩石的压缩性对整个岩体的压缩性有很大贡献。因此，**完整岩石的泊松比对节理岩体的泊松比有显著影响**。

A single Poisson’s ratio, ν, is, strictly speaking, defined only for isotropic elastic materials. However, there are only a few jointing patterns which lead to isotropic elastic properties for a rock mass.
Therefore, it is convenient to define a “Poisson effect” that can be used for discussion of anisotropic materials.
>严格来说，单泊松比ν仅适用于各向同性弹性材料。然而，只有少数节理模式导致岩体具有各向同性弹性特性。因此，可以方便地定义可用于讨论各向异性材料的“泊松效应”。

The Poisson effect will be defined as the ratio of horizontal-to-vertical stress when a load is applied in the vertical direction and no strain is allowed in the horizontal direction. Plane strain conditions are assumed. As an example, the Poisson effect for an isotropic elastic material is
>泊松效应将被定义为当在垂直方向施加载荷且水平方向不允许应变时，水平应力与垂直应力的比值。假设平面应变条件。例如，各向同性弹性材料的泊松效应为

$$\frac{\sigma_{x x}}{\sigma_{y y}}=\frac{v}{1-v} \tag {3.2}$$

Consider the Poisson effect produced by the vertical jointing pattern shown in Figure 3.15. If this jointing were modeled with rigid blocks, applying a vertical stress would produce no horizontal stress at all. This is clearly unrealistic because the horizontal stress produced by the Poisson’s ratio of the intact rock is ignored.
>考虑图3.15所示的垂直连接模式产生的泊松效应。如果用刚性块模拟这种连接，施加垂直应力将根本不会产生水平应力。这显然是不现实的，因为忽略了完整岩石泊松比产生的水平应力。

>3.15 具有垂直和水平节理的岩石中的泊松效应模型

The joints and intact rock act in series. In other words, the stresses acting on the joints and on the rock are identical. The total strain of the jointed rock mass is the sum of the strain due to the jointing and the strain due to the compressibility of the rock. The elastic properties of the rock mass as a whole can be derived by adding the compliances of the jointing and the intact rock:
>节理和完整岩石相互作用。换句话说，**作用在节理和岩石上的应力是相同的**。**节理岩体的总应变是节理引起的应变和岩石压缩性引起的应变之和**。岩体作为一个整体的弹性特性可以通过添加节理和完整岩石的柔度得出：

$$\left[\begin{array}{l}
\epsilon_{x x} \\
\epsilon_{y y}
\end{array}\right]=\left(C^{\text {rock }}+C \text { jointing }\right)\left[\begin{array}{l}
\sigma_{x x} \\
\sigma_{y y}
\end{array}\right] \tag{3.3}$$
If the intact rock were modeled as an isotropic elastic material, its compliance matrix would be
>**如果将完整岩石建模为各向同性弹性材料，则其柔度矩阵将为**

$$C^{\mathrm{rock}}=\frac{1+v}{E}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1-v & -v \\
-v & 1-v
\end{array}\right] \tag{3.4}$$
The compliance matrix due to the jointing is

$$C^{\text {jointing }}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{S k_{n}} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{S k_{n}}
\end{array}\right] \tag{3.5}$$
